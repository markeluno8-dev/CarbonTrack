# 🌍 CarbonTrack: Blockchain Ledger for Industrial Carbon Capture

Welcome to CarbonTrack, a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project addresses the real-world challenge of climate change by providing a transparent, verifiable ledger for industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS). It enables industries to register captured carbon, verify long-term storage, issue carbon credits, and facilitate seamless cross-border transfers of those credits—reducing fraud, ensuring compliance, and incentivizing global carbon reduction efforts.

## ✨ Features

🌱 Register carbon capture events with verifiable data  
🔒 Immutable verification of carbon storage using oracles or third-party audits  
💰 Issue tokenized carbon credits based on verified storage  
🌐 Enable cross-border transfers of credits with low fees and instant settlement  
📊 Real-time compliance reporting and audit trails  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanisms for contested claims  
🚀 Scalable for global industries, regulators, and carbon markets  
🔐 Secure role-based access for participants (e.g., capturers, verifiers, buyers)

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Industrial Capturers**  
- Collect data on captured CO2 (e.g., volume, method, location).  
- Generate a unique hash of the capture report.  
- Call the `register-capture` function in the CaptureRegistry contract with the hash, metadata (e.g., timestamp, site ID), and supporting evidence.  
Your capture event is now timestamped and logged immutably on the blockchain!

**For Storage Verifiers**  
- Use external oracles or integrated APIs to confirm long-term storage (e.g., geological sequestration).  
- Submit verification proofs via the `verify-storage` function in the StorageVerifier contract.  
- Once approved, credits are automatically issued through the CreditIssuer contract.

**For Credit Buyers/Transfers**  
- Browse available credits using the `get-credit-details` function.  
- Purchase or transfer credits cross-border via the `transfer-credit` function in the CreditTransfer contract—handling currency conversions and compliance checks automatically.  
No intermediaries needed; everything settles on-chain.

**For Regulators and Auditors**  
- Query the ledger with functions like `generate-report` in the Reporting contract to view aggregated data.  
- Use the DisputeResolver contract to flag and resolve any discrepancies.

This system solves key problems in carbon markets: lack of transparency, double-counting of credits, and barriers to international trading. By leveraging blockchain, it ensures trustless verification and reduces administrative overhead.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

CarbonTrack is powered by 8 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of the workflow for modularity and security. Here's a high-level breakdown:

1. **UserRegistry.clar** - Manages participant registration and roles (e.g., capturer, verifier, regulator). Includes functions for KYC-like verification and access control.  
2. **CaptureRegistry.clar** - Handles registration of carbon capture events. Stores hashes, metadata, and timestamps; prevents duplicates with unique IDs.  
3. **StorageVerifier.clar** - Verifies storage proofs submitted by oracles or auditors. Uses multi-signature approvals for high-stakes verifications.  
4. **CreditIssuer.clar** - Issues ERC-721-like NFTs or fungible tokens representing carbon credits based on verified data. Calculates credit amounts using predefined formulas (e.g., tons of CO2 stored).  
5. **CreditTransfer.clar** - Facilitates secure transfers of credits between users, including cross-border logic for tax/compliance metadata. Supports atomic swaps.  
6. **ComplianceChecker.clar** - Enforces rules like emission standards and geographic restrictions. Automatically checks transfers against global regulations.  
7. **DisputeResolver.clar** - Allows flagging of suspicious events and resolves disputes via voting or arbitration. Locks credits during resolution.  
8. **Reporting.clar** - Generates on-chain reports and analytics, such as total captured CO2 or credit circulation. Supports querying for audits.

These contracts interact via traits and public functions, ensuring a composable architecture. For example, a successful verification in StorageVerifier triggers CreditIssuer automatically.
